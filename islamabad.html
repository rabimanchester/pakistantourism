        <p>The master plan for the city was designed by Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis and divides the city into eight zones, including administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, as well as rural and green areas which are administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the Capital Development Authority. Islamabad is known for the presence of several parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian.[12] It is home to several landmarks, with the most notable one being the Faisal Mosque, the largest mosque in South Asia[13] and the fifth-largest in the world. Other landmarks include the Pakistan National Monument and the Democracy Square.[14][15][16]
