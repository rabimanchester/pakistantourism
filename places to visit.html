        <P class="par">In Pakistan, tourism is a growing industry. In 2010, Lonely Planet termed Pakistan "tourism's 'next big thing' for more years than we care to remember". The country is geographically and ethnically diverse, and has a number of historical and cultural heritage sites. The upsurge in tourism in the past few years has been aided by the Government of Pakistan's recent decision to end mandatory No Objection Certificates for foreign tourists seeking to visit certain parts of the country.[4]

            Pakistan was ranked The Best Holiday Destination for 2020[5] and was also declared the third-highest potential adventure destination in the world for 2020.[5] As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has increased by more than 300%.[6] The Pakistani government has launched online visa services for 175 countries[7] and 50 countries were offered visa on arrival,[8] making a visit to Pakistan easier. The country received an influx of travel vloggers, who showed the beauty of the country, especially the northern areas Hunza and Skardu.[9]</P>
