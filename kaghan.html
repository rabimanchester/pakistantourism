        <h1>Kaghan</h1>
        <p>The Kaghan Valley (Urdu: وادی کاغان‎) is an alpine valley located in the Mansehra District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.[1][2][3] The valley covers a distance of 155 kilometres (96 mi)[4] across northern Pakistan, rising from its lowest elevation of 650 m (2,134 ft) to its highest point at the Babusar Pass around 4,170 m (13,690 ft).[5] Landslides triggered by the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake destroyed many passes leading into the valley, though roads have since been largely rebuilt. The Kaghan is a highly popular tourist attraction.[6][7][8]</p>
